# Validate Characters
#### Daily Byte - Day 22

Given a string only containing the following characters `(`, `)`, `{`, `}`, `[`, and `]` return whether or not the opening and closing characters are in a valid order.

Ex: Given the following strings...
```
"(){}[]", return true
"(({[]}))", return true
"{(})", return false
```

Dev's Note:
I got a bit carrier away. Definitely could have made a stack using arrays and possibly no need to make a pop and some other functions but I just wanted to do it, so did it.
